# Cmri-node-list-used-for-my-layout
This is the index for all of the nodes on my layout.

--------------
Node 1 T1 Peel turnout and signals and 5 sensors closed 70 thrown 108.
  
  This needs to have a extra pin added to allow control of lighting on the scene we have a number of pins available to use with a mosfet attached.
  
  It makes sense to use pin 12 for the extra light control as a standardization through out the units.

--------------
Node 2 T2 Peel to Dock turnout and signals and 5 sensors closed 110 thrown 70.
  
  This node is complete and needs nothing added unless I add the mine lift in which case it could be altered to include a trigger to start the seperate nano             controlling the mine lift.

-------------
Node 3 T3 Upper to Lower level turnout  and signals and 2 sensors closed 108 thrown 80.
  
  This node I feel no further work is required.

-------------
TESTING stage of the cross over in the dock area

Node 4 T4 Docks to Platform 1 or siding crossover Added a light control for using with a mosfet on pin 4 jmri 4002 no signals planned

Node 5 T5 Dock siding to crossover Added a light control for using with a mosfet on pin 4 jmri 5002 no signals planned
